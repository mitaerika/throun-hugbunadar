- Search engine for day tours offered in Iceland (glærupakki 1 bls.34)
- Availability-based booking with hotel pickup option (glærupakki 1 bls.34)
- Let users search and book day tours in Iceland  (glærupakki 1 bls.4)
  - You maintain a database of tours (about a dozen fictional services are sufficient) 
that you query based on search parameters of your choice

booking reduces the available seats etc.
  - Your component only provides a rudimentary user interface to test this functionality
